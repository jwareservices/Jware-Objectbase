# Jware-Objectbase
_A Java based object persistence library_

THIS ARCHIVE/REPO HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED IN YEARS, BUT I'D LIKE TO GET BACK TO IT AGAIN.  THE IDEA IS SIMPLY TOO BUILD IT FOR FUN.  IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT AND ONE THAT I MAY PORT TO C++.

The test classes **ObjectBase** and **ObjectBaseTestGui** run in console and graphical mode respectively.
They should be fairly self explanatory to use.  The console version is no longer in build, but it 
works for simple testing, there may be errors thrown too as I'm now working on the GUI based test.

So the GUI test class is in a build phase and as such runs, but errors are
likely to be thrown, so don't be too concerned, I'll get to them.

The GUI is being built with **Swing**, if you have a better suggestion
I'd love to hear it.

In the end the GUI test class will be a case use example of the library.

The whole library is in the build phase, there's a lot left to do.

I do try to stabilize things before I commit my changes, but there times when I push the library up 
even though there may be Instability.

Also documentation is coming, I try to doc as I go...but that does not always go as planned.

If you have any suggestions or comments please email me at: paul@jwareservices.com

I'd love to hear from anyone about this project.
